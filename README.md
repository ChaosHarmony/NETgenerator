# NETgenerator
A random generator for Cyberpunk RED 's NET dimension. I'll try to code a random NET infrastructure for cyberpunk RED, mostly in python. When the python version suits me well i'll maybe make it in rust to learn the language.

# Description

The generator aims to randomize a NET architecture, ruled by the GM's needs. It can be for instance a floor cap, overall difficulty level, infrastructure cost...
